# Arduino-Infrared-Touch-Interface-
Programs to run on Arduino boards to create a cheap infrared touch interface.
These programs correspond to the devices one can build from my instructables link: http://www.instructables.com/id/Cheap-Infrared-Touch-Surface/?ALLSTEPS

The instructable details the use of the different files within this repository, it also has a demonstration video that corresponds with the project.
